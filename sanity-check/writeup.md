# Sanity Check

## Challenge Description
As you can see, this is not a traditional CTF portal. Don't be shy though and chat with our bot. I'm sure you're gonna figure how to use our Discord and how to get some flags!

## Solution
1. Join the CTF's Discord server.
2. Locate the "1753CTF" bot on the server.
3. Run the `/get_flag` command, which has a comment saying "Might help you with a flag".
4. The bot responds with the flag:

> I think you might look for this
>
> 1753c{weeelcome_to_the_party}

Flag: `1753c{weeelcome_to_the_party}`

### Conclusion
The "Sanity Check" challenge is a simple introduction to the CTF hosted on Discord. By exploring the available commands and interacting with the "1753CTF" bot, participants can easily obtain the flag using the `/get_flag` command.
